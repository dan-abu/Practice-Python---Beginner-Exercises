# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

#Solution
num = int(input('Kindly select a number: '))
options = range(1, (num+1))
divisors = []
for x in options:
    if num % x == 0:
        divisors.append(x)
print(divisors)
